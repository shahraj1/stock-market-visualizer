# stock-market-visualizer
Given an API - creates a chart using matplotlib in py for a "US" universe of tickers. 


YOU WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE **{API-KEY}** with your own key. I am using the **EODHD API**, which allows **20 hits/day and 500 total welcome hits**. Might change that with a different URL, but the format should be the same. 



**RUN**

Simply run py Visualizer.py
